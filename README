Lincense Issue:
  Some of the images used for experiments are not authorized. No commercial use is allowed.

How to Use the Program:
  1. Compile the the source code and link anything needed to generate an executable;
  In the subsequent section, suppose you are using the executable on Windows.
  2. Fire up your terminal and direct to the directory where the executable resides;
  3. Run the executable according to the following format
	executable_name.exe n i [o]
    where n is the number of images in i,
          i is the name of a file containing the absolute paths and names of the images used for joining (each image occupies one line),
          o is the optional output file name.

Example of i:
  File name: example.txt
  Content:
    some_path_to_the_image/img1.jpg
    some_path_to_the_image/img2.jpg
    ...

Note:
  1. OpenCV is required to compile this code;
  2. 10389231_Project_1.pdf is a report on this implementation. It covers the concept of joiners, an overview of the methods used, and experiemt results.
